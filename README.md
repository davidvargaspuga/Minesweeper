# Minesweeper
A solution in C to the minesweeper game with focus on the board,
reading boards from a file, recursion and game logic. 


A user will start a game and enter a series of clicks along with the click type. 
The minesweep board will be processed/updated according to these clicks:

(1) process simulated clicks on the gameboard and 

(2) checks if the game is won or not. 

This solution is scalable to allow for any board size (as long as it can be
loaded into memory).
